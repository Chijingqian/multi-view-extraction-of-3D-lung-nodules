# multi-view-extraction-of-3D-lung-nodules
Partial Implementation of a Paper named 'Knowledge-based Collaborative Deep Learning for Benign-Malignant Lung Nodule ClassiÔ¨Åcation on Chest CT '

In order to get more and better features, we can extract nine 2D slices not only on the transverse, sagittal, coronal but also other six diagonal planes,respectively, where each diagonal plane cuts two opposite faces of the cube in diagonal and has two opposite edges of
the cube and four vertices. Thus, we obtain nine views of slices for each 3D nodule.
